Feature 3: Add a new dropdown component below the existing Status dropdown - COMPLETED

Changes made:
1. Added getDepartments() method to api.service.ts (line 60-62)
2. Added Department dropdown HTML in form.component.html (lines 83-100) - placed directly below Status dropdown
3. Added departmentOptions, selectedDepartment, departmentLoading properties to form.component.ts
4. Added onDepartmentFocus() and onDepartmentChange() methods to form.component.ts

The new Department dropdown:
- Has a label "Department"
- Has placeholder text "Select Department"
- Loads options on focus (lazy-loaded)
- Maintains consistent styling with Status dropdown
- Selection is captured via ngModel binding

Feature 6: Add a new Landing page - COMPLETED

Changes made:
1. Created new LandingComponent in src/app/landing/ directory:
   - landing.component.ts - Component logic with userId handling and navigation to Form page
   - landing.component.html - Template with "Landing" title and square "Form" card
   - landing.component.css - Styling consistent with existing design system
2. Added 'landing' route to app-routing.module.ts (line 9)
3. Registered LandingComponent in app.module.ts declarations (line 26)
4. Modified HomeComponent to redirect to /landing after login instead of staying on page:
   - Removed isLoggedIn and loggedInUser properties
   - Updated onLogin() to navigate to /landing with userId query param
   - Removed onFormCardClick() method (moved to LandingComponent)
5. Simplified home.component.html to show only the login screen

The new Landing page:
- Displays "Landing" as the page title
- Shows a single square card with "Form" title (150x150px)
- Clicking the Form card navigates to /form with userId as query param
- Redirects to home if accessed without userId
- Maintains consistent styling with existing design system
